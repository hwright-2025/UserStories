Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

| As an NICHD program officer, I want to verify that researchers are using data repositories appropriate for the scientific data they plan to share and that their DMS Plan is consistent with the repository's expectations and requirements  | When I look at a data repository's website it can be difficult to determine the repository's requirements, expectations, and processes (e.g., accepted data types, metadata, formats, other standards, submission agreements, whether it is controlled access). It is also time consuming to look at many repository websites to determine if its appropriate. | My goal is to determine whether the researcher is adequately planning to share their scientific data in data repositories to adhere to the DMS Policy's expectations. | NICHD Staff | High - It is critical this gets addressed as soon as possible | Emails from Program Officers assessing plans
