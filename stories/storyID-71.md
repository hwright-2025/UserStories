Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

# S71: As the NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing, we want to distinguish real from perceived barriers to researchers' data science and sharing goals so we can develop resources that solve real challenges

| What does the user want to be able to do? | Why can't the user do this today? | What's the user's ultimate goal? 
| As the NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing, we want to distinguish real from perceived barriers to researchers' data science and sharing goals so we can develop resources that solve real challenges   | Today when we receive researcher feedback, the ultimate goals and barriers to achieving those goals are not clear, as researchers tend to focus on quick fixes for their immediate challenges rather than comprehensive solutions    | Our goal is to understand whether barriers are real or perceived, to inform how to help researchers achieve their goals in the NICHD data ecosystem
