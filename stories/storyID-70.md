Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.
