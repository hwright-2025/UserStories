Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts.

| As an NIH data repository, I want to facilitate longitudinal data analysis of de-identified data from multiple studies to enable data users to study the impact of long COVID in children  | Our policy is to only accept and share de-identified data, so it’s not possible to determine which participants are the same across studies and enable users to study the same participants at multiple time points | My goal is to enable participant-level linkage in children across multiple studies and data repositories
