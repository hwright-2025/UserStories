Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

### Current Problem
Our policy is to only accept and share de-identified data, so it’s not possible to determine which participants are the same across studies and enable users to study the same participants at multiple time points    
### User 
Other
### Impact
Medium - I can work around this but it is unpleasant
### User Goal
My goal is to enable participant-level linkage in children across multiple studies and data repositories
