Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

| As an NICHD (intramural or extramural) researcher, I want to find the best data repositories for sharing scientific data that I am generating in my project and understand the repository's submission and sharing practices so I can complete my DMS Plan. | When I look at a data repository's website it can be difficult to determine the repository's requirements, expectations, and processes (e.g., accepted data types, metadata, formats, other standards, submission agreements, whether it is controlled access). It is also time consuming to look at many repository websites to determine if its appropriate.  | My goal is to adhere to the expectations of the DMS Policy which expects maximizing the sharing of scientific data generated in my project
