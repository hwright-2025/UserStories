Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

| As a researcher/clinician, I want to combine participant-level data collected from multiple studies and data repositories to merge multiple data types for each participant and avoid working with inflated sample sizes to effectively study COVID in children.  | We believe the same children were recruited for multiple studies with different data collection protocols and the data are shared through multiple data repositories, but we donâ€™t have a way to identify which children are the same without sharing personally identifiable information which is not allowed by our IRB | My goal is to enable participant-level linkage in children across multiple studies and data repositories
