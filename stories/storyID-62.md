Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate ecosystem Efforts.

| As a researcher, I want to use DASH BPCA data to train, validate, and test an AI/ML model that predicts adverse events due to antibiotics for intra-abdominal infections in infants with the aim toward recommending the best antibiotic for a patient | Today, I have no idea whether these data are "AI-ready" and how much time and effort it would take to prepare the data to develop, train, or use an AI/ML model | My goal is to understand the AI-readiness of the data
