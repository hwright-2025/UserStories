# User Stories
Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered from the NICHD community, and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts. 

Each story listed below has been selected to drive a data ecosystem effort.
