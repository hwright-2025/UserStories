# User Stories
Each user story is an informal, general explanation of a desired ecosystem feature or process written from the perspective of a specific end user. The purpose of a User Story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the user. User stories are gathered by NICHD from their Ecosystem Working Group, and are used to initiate Ecosystem efforts. 

Each story listed below has been selected to drive a data ecosystem improvement effort.
